# Dog-Picker
 A website where you vote on random images of dogs together with other people on the internet. Built with React JS, Node JS, Socket.IO and Express.JS

### About
The frontend is built with React. The backend is build with Node JS, and especially Socket.IO and a bit Express.JS. I use Axios to get images of dogs from the API over at dog.ceo.
