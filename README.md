# Dog-Picker
 A website where you vote on random images of dogs together with other people on the internet. Built with React JS, Node JS, Socket.IO and Express.JS

### About
The frontend is built with React and Sass. The backend is build with Node JS, and especially Socket.IO and a bit of Express.JS. I use Axios to get images of dogs from the API over at dog.ceo. It then gets sent over the the users who vote in real-time on which dog they like the most. A new round gets started if all has voted, and there is a timer that eventually will end the round even if not everyone has voted.
